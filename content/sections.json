    "content": "Joseph Moeller is a writer, teacher, and Zen practitioner based in the Hudson Valley, New York. His work explores the intersection of contemplative practice, daily life, and the written word.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nBorn in 1968 in rural Vermont, Moeller grew up surrounded by forests and farmland. He studied literature and philosophy at Middlebury College before spending two years at a Zen monastery in Kyoto, Japan, under the guidance of Roshi Yamada Koun.\n\nZEN PRACTICE\n\nMoeller has maintained a daily sitting practice for over thirty years. He completed formal koan study in the Sanbo Zen lineage and received authorization to teach in 2008. He leads regular zazen sessions and seasonal retreats at Stone Bridge Zendo, the practice center he founded in 2012.\n\nWRITING\n\nHis writing draws on the directness of Zen expression — spare, attentive, rooted in the present moment. He has published six books on Zen practice, meditation, and contemplative living. His essays have appeared in Tricycle, Lion's Roar, Shambhala Sun, and Buddhadharma.\n\nTEACHING\n\nMoeller leads retreats and workshops throughout the United States and Japan. His teaching emphasizes the integration of formal meditation practice with everyday awareness — what he calls \"the practice of ordinary life.\"\n\nHe lives with his wife and two dogs near the Catskill Mountains, where he writes, sits, and tends a small garden.",
